## 4. Get Your API Token

1. In your Basehub repository, go to Settings â†’ API
2. Create a new API token with read permissions
3. Copy the token

## 5. Configure Your Environment

Create a `.env.local` file in your project root:

```env
BASEHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
```

## 6. Generate Types

After setting up your schema in Basehub, run:

```bash
pnpm basehub
```

This will update the `basehub-types.d.ts` file with your schema types.

## 7. Update Your Code

The code has been prepared to use Basehub instead of MDX files. Once you complete the steps above:

1. The stories page will automatically fetch from Basehub
2. Individual story pages will use Basehub content
3. You can manage all stories through the Basehub dashboard

## Next Steps

1. Complete the Basehub setup as described above
2. Run `pnpm basehub` to generate the correct types
3. Test the integration locally
4. Deploy your changes
