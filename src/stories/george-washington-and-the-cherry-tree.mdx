Young George Washington was known for his curiosity and energy, traits that would later serve him well in leading a nation. One day, after being given a shiny new hatchet, George’s excitement got the better of him. He wandered around the family farm, eager to test his new tool on the trees lining the yard.

In his innocent haste, George came upon a tall cherry tree. Without much thought, he swung his hatchet and delivered a sharp blow to the tree’s trunk. The cut was deep, and George quickly realized the damage he'd caused. The bark split, and the tree was unlikely to survive.

Later that day, George’s father, Augustine Washington, noticed the scarred tree. It was one of his favorites, planted many years ago. With concern and frustration, he sought out his son. “George,” his father called in a firm voice, “do you know what happened to the cherry tree in the yard?”

George, heart pounding, felt the weight of his father’s question. He knew that admitting the truth could lead to punishment. Yet something inside him, something his parents had taught him, pressed him to speak up.

He took a deep breath, met his father’s gaze, and said, “Father, I cannot tell a lie. I cut the tree with my hatchet.”

For a moment, the air seemed heavy. Augustine Washington’s face softened. He put a hand on his son’s shoulder, nodding slowly. “My son, your honesty means more to me than a thousand cherry trees. You’ve shown great courage in telling the truth, and that is something I will always be proud of.”

Though George had damaged the tree, he had done something far more valuable that day—he upheld his character. And in that moment, George learned that a man’s word, when given in truth, was worth more than anything material.
